SoftUni course - Java Fundamentals

After Programing Basics course with Python i decided to continue my journey with Java.
Even though i am on a begginers level of programming i thought it would be harder to switch languages.
I needed like 1, 2 days top to learn the basic differences between these 2 languages and now i am ready to dive into the new course!
